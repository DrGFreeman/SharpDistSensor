This example shows how to use the SharpDistSensor library to continuously
read the sensor and display the measured distance in mm to the serial monitor.

The library default values corresponding to the Sharp GP2Y0A60SZLF 5V sensor
are used.

See the library README for how to use pre-defined sensor models or custom
fit functions.
