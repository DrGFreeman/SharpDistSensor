SharpDistSensor; Sharp analog distance sensor library

This is a library for the Arduino IDE that helps interface with Sharp IR analog
distance sensors.

The analog value from the sensor is converted to distance using either a fifth
order polynomial fit function or a power fit function.

By default, this library is set to use polynomial coefficients calibrated for
the Sharp GP2Y0A60SZLF Analog Distance Sensor 10-150cm 5V, over a range of
50-1500 mm (analog values 30-875). The returned distance is in millimeters (mm)
units.  For different accuracy, range, sensor model or units, different
coefficients may be required.

Use the setModel method to change the sensor model calibration. The following
models are currently supported:
-GP2Y0A60SZLF_5V (GP2Y0A60SZLF Analog Distance Sensor 10-150cm, 5V)
-GP2Y0A710K0F_5V_DS (GP2Y0A710K0F Analog Distance Sensor 100-500cm, 5V)

Use the setPolyFitCoeffs method to define custom polynomial coefficients.

Use the setPowerFitCoeffs method to define custom power coefficients.

Use the setValMinMax method to define different analog values range.

The distance output is filtered using median filtering. MedianFilter class from
the following library is used: https://github.com/daPhoosa/MedianFilter.
